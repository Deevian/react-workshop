# React 101

## Setup

You need to have the latest [`node`][node], [`npm`][npm] (or [`yarn`][yarn]), and [`git`][git] installed. Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Deevian/react-workshop
cd react-workshop
npm i
```

### All set up!

If you want to explore a bit, there are a few things you can do:

1. Go ahead and open `intro/exercises-final/01-js.html` in a browser (don't peek at the solution!). It should say `Hello World`. Go ahead and open the others if you like.
2. Then you could run the app with `npm run start`. This should pop open a window with a stopwatch which we'll be building.
